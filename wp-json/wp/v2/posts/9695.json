Also, because the cards used have either a magnetic stripe, or a chip-and-signature technology rather than the chip\/personal identification number (PIN), technology found in most European countries, the United States is a significant target.<\/span><\/p>\n<h2><span class=\"wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight\" data-id=\"3\">How carding works<\/span><\/h2>\n<p><span class=\"wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight\" data-id=\"18\">Hackers typically gain access to a website&#8217;s credit card processing systems. The hacker then obtains a list or credit cards or debit cards that have been used recently to make a purchase.<\/span> <span class=\"wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight\" data-id=\"10\">Hackers could exploit security flaws in credit card account protection technology and software.<\/span> <span class=\"wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight\" data-id=\"9\">They could also use scanners to copy the code from magnetic strips and obtain credit card information.<\/span><\/p>\n<div data-tracking-container=\"true\" data-tracking-id=\"mntl-sc-block-callout\">\n<p><span class=\"wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight\" data-id=\"11\">Carding refers to credit card fraud where a stolen credit cards is used for charging prepaid cards.<\/span><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p><span class=\"wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight\" data-id=\"1\">Credit card information might also be compromised by accessing the account holder&#8217;s other personal information, such as bank accounts the hacker has already gained entry to, targeting the information at its source.<\/span> <span class=\"wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight\" data-id=\"15\">The hacker then sells the credit and debit card numbers to a third-party, a carder, who uses the stolen information for a gift card purchase.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight\" data-id=\"2\">Most credit card companies offer cardholders protection from charges made if a credit or debit card is reported stolen, but by the time the cards are canceled, the carder has often made a purchase.<\/span> <span class=\"wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight\" data-id=\"13\">These gift cards can be used to buy high-value goods such as computers, cell phones, and televisions.<\/span> <span class=\"wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight\" data-id=\"16\">The cardholder may purchase a gift card from an electronics retailer like <a href=\"http:\/\/Amazon.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon<\/a>. They might use a third-party to receive the goods, and then ship them to another location.<\/span> <span class=\"wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight\" data-id=\"6\">This reduces the risk that the carder will be noticed.<\/span> <span class=\"wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight\" data-id=\"7\">Websites that offer anonymity may allow the carder to sell the goods.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span class=\"wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight\" data-id=\"14\">Credit cards can be canceled quickly after they are lost. Carding involves checking the card information to make sure it is still working.<\/span> <span class=\"wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight\" data-id=\"5\">This could involve sending purchase requests online.<\/span><\/p>\n<pre><span class=\"wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight\" data-id=\"3\">Carding refers to the illegal and trafficked use of credit cards.<\/span> \r\n<span class=\"wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight\" data-id=\"4\">To cover up the tracks, stolen credit cards and credit card numbers can be used to \r\npurchase prepaid gift cards.<\/span> <span class=\"wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight\" data-id=\"2\">Other activities include the exploitation of personal \r\ninformation and money laundering<\/span><\/pre>\n<table style=\"border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2857%; text-align: center;\"><strong>carding cc<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2857%; text-align: center;\"><strong>real carding sites<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2857%; text-align: center;\"><strong>is carding safe<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2857%; text-align: center;\"><strong>is carding illegal<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2857%; text-align: center;\"><strong>free carding websites<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2857%; text-align: center;\"><strong>carding amazon<\/strong><\/td>\n<td style=\"width: 14.2857%;\"><\/td>\n<\/tr>\n<\/tbody>\n<\/table>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is Carding?
