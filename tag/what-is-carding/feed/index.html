<p><span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="12"><a href="https://cardingteam.ru/">Carding</a> refers to credit card fraud where a stolen credit cards is used for charging prepaid cards.</span> <span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="17">The theft of a credit card can lead to the holder of the card buying store-branded gift certificates, which can then either be sold or used to buy other goods that can be traded for cash.</span> <span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="8">Card thieves are credit card fraudsters who are involved in this type.</span></p>
<p><span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="19">Because the United States is a major target for credit card fraud, it has a large market where credit card and debit card use are common. Also, because the cards used have either a magnetic stripe, or a chip-and-signature technology rather than the chip/personal identification number (PIN), technology found in most European countries, the United States is a significant target.</span></p>
<h2><span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="3">How carding works</span></h2>
<p><span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="18">Hackers typically gain access to a website&#8217;s credit card processing systems. The hacker then obtains a list or credit cards or debit cards that have been used recently to make a purchase.</span> <span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="10">Hackers could exploit security flaws in credit card account protection technology and software.</span> <span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="9">They could also use scanners to copy the code from magnetic strips and obtain credit card information.</span></p>
<div data-tracking-container="true" data-tracking-id="mntl-sc-block-callout">
<p><span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="11">Carding refers to credit card fraud where a stolen credit cards is used for charging prepaid cards.</span></p>
</div>
<p><span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="1">Credit card information might also be compromised by accessing the account holder&#8217;s other personal information, such as bank accounts the hacker has already gained entry to, targeting the information at its source.</span> <span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="15">The hacker then sells the credit and debit card numbers to a third-party, a carder, who uses the stolen information for a gift card purchase.</span></p>
<p><span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="2">Most credit card companies offer cardholders protection from charges made if a credit or debit card is reported stolen, but by the time the cards are canceled, the carder has often made a purchase.</span> <span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="13">These gift cards can be used to buy high-value goods such as computers, cell phones, and televisions.</span> <span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="16">The cardholder may purchase a gift card from an electronics retailer like <a href="http://Amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon</a>. They might use a third-party to receive the goods, and then ship them to another location.</span> <span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="6">This reduces the risk that the carder will be noticed.</span> <span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="7">Websites that offer anonymity may allow the carder to sell the goods.</span></p>
<p><span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="14">Credit cards can be canceled quickly after they are lost. Carding involves checking the card information to make sure it is still working.</span> <span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="5">This could involve sending purchase requests online.</span></p>
<pre><span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="3">Carding refers to the illegal and trafficked use of credit cards.</span> 
<span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="4">To cover up the tracks, stolen credit cards and credit card numbers can be used to 
purchase prepaid gift cards.</span> <span class="wordai-block rewrite-block enable-highlight" data-id="2">Other activities include the exploitation of personal 
information and money laundering</span></pre>
